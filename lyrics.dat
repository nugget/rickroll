Oooh

We're no stran-gers to love {1500}
You know the rules {300} and so {150} do I
A full com-mit-ment's what I'm {250} thinking of
You wouldn't get this from {250} any oth-er guy

I {1500} just wan-na tell you how I'm feel-ing
Got-ta make you {300} un-der-stand

Never gonna give {250} you {250} up {400}
Never gonna let {250} you {250} down {400}
Never gonna run {300} a-round and {250} de-sert you {500}
Never gonna make {250} you {250} cry {400}
Never gonna say {400} good-bye {250}
Never gonna tell {250} a lie {300} and hurt {250} you {2000}

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but

Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
